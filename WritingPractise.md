## Some people think that students should study at school instead of via internet. To what extent do you agree or disagree？

In recent years, the industry of education has changed rapidly accompany with the development of modern technology such as internet. Some of the traditional people considers students should study at school rather than internet. I totally agree that students study at school is beneficial to internet.

Firstly, Students should go school to study. When students tend to receive education in a traditional place, they are able to acquire reliable knowledge. This is because the materials which students use as school are compiled and supervised by experts in specific fields. For example, middle school students could master algorithm in mathematical classrooms correctly by means of the textbooks edited by some kind of Mathematical expert in famous universities in China. Otherwise, they might get a not exact answer or the method of math question from internet, because anyone can upload their answer to internet without limitation. On the other hand, students go physical school accept education will be face to face with lecturers. So every single interacting behavior need young students use body language, facial expressions and emotions to react with other people. This sort of communicating way will improve students confidentiality, communicating skills and bravery.

Secondly, Students should not study via internet. Since the government has different censorship on internet, the information content really complicated. The internet just like a huge pool which put the good and bad stuff on there. Young students have not too much social experience, they can not distinguish the information such as violence, pornography and cyber trap. So let students study on internet will result in them get some negative effects in the process of growth. Not only influences their academic performance, but also might brings an enormous risks to them. For instance, New Zealand does not have pornography censorship, so any one can access these content on internet. According to Otago Dairy Times state that there are too many parents does not satisfies their kids learning on internet and sometimes surfing on internet to watching these information, and these parent does not have right way to protect their children.

In conclusion, students should study at school rather than on internet. The reason just like I have mentioned above that is not good for students health grown up and learning efficiency.

On the one hand, 企业之所以去支付他们所造成的污染，是因为其目的是为了盈利。
解释：企业生产 - 盈利同时 - 造成的污染。这个过程造成了负面效应 - 所以企业应该去支付。

Companies are normally responsible for the producing behaviours which are more likely to result in contamination by means of paying for the money. negative effect on society, like pollution in particular. For this reason this kind of behavior can influence on physical conditions for people and therefore those companies should compensate people and society for the purposes of being profitable.

家长通常缺乏

老师比家长在提升智力的方面更为专业。这是因为绝大部分的老师在开始职业之前是接受过专业的训练。并且在工作后，能够积累大量的教学经验。因此，他们所获得的这些知识可以更科学的去培养孩子们的脑力。相反的是家长通常缺乏这方面的教学背景和相关经验。

In comparison with parents, teachers are more likely to be professional in the promotion of intelligence. This is because most of those teachers have received theory-based training before career, and they can also accumulate an amount of experience. For this reason, the practices they access is able to allow them to cultivate their students' brainpower scientifically by means of imparting knowledge. Otherwise, parents normally lack related educational background and specific working experience.

家长比老师更具备影响力在社交发展，家长有更多的机会去带领孩子去参加社交活动 比老师

家长的日常职责就是陪伴孩子而非其他专业任务，所有日常中，社交活动可能使得家长和孩子共同参与，从而在这个过程，孩子可以去模仿家长与人交流的合理方式，从而提高设计技能。相反的是，老师更加在关注学生学习而非社交技能。

Parents play a important role to children in the affect of social skill developing. Compare to teachers they have more chances to bring children participating social activities.

The daily basis route of parents is stay with children together and taking care of them, rather than other tasks. So there are much largar possibilities to make sure childen paticepating social activities coming with parents, they also be affect by parents and other people's behaviour.

Regarding of the working basis of teachers, family life makes it more possible to be engaged in social activities for their cildren.

This is because core duty of parents is to lay emphasis on accompany and care-giving not other aspects. In this sense, social interaction in a family allows all family members to be involved, which means the behavours

Instead, students' academic performance is priority for their teachers instead of other aspects like socializing.

艺术通常只能满足人们的精神需求，但是提高生活质量的最明显因素应该是物质需求。因此，单纯的满足人们的精神上的需求不可能提高人们的生活水平。

The arts could demand the requirements of peoples' mental activities. However, the basic needs of people are based on the physical way such as eating, clothing and so on. So only demands peoples mental activities could not improve their life level.

Commonly, humanities are capable of fulfilling the function of enhancement of life standards exclusively, while the most significant factor influencing on life is related to material satisfaction. In this way, satisfying psychological demand fails to improve people's life straightforwardly.
