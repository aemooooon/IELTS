> To detract is to diminish, take away from, or reduce the value of (something). The word is mainly used intransitively (i.e., not requiring a direct object), and its usually followed by from. For instance, a pile of unfinished work might detract from your enjoyment of a football game. Distract, which is always used transitively (meaning that it must have a direct object), means to divert attention or interest. The verb almost always acts directly on the person or thing being distracted. For instance, your unfinished work might distract you from a football game.
